Use K-Nearest Neighbours on each bit of the dataset:
    -Movie Age Rating -> User Rating A (Model A)
        --Seperate all age ratings into a specific number:
            ---Approved = 0
            ---G = 1
            ---GP = 2
            ---etc.            
    -Run Length -> User Rating B (Model B)
        --Convert the run length to minutes.
    -Genre -> User Rating C (Model C)
        --Seperate the genre for each movie!
        --Some movies have multiple genres seperated by a semi-colon.
        --Take the user rating of each genre and get the average rating.
    -Release Month -> User Rating D (Model D)

Then, take Ratings A, B, C and D and get the average.
This will represent the model's overall prediction for a new movie's user rating.
